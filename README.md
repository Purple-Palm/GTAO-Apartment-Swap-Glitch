I (the creator) was banned after generating $200M in 4 hours. My friend used this for $10M and is safe.
**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** Recommended limit: 10M-20M per week.

## Description
This is a Python replacement for the old AutoHotKey (AHK) scripts. It uses Computer Vision (OpenCV) to detect buttons on the screen, making it more reliable than simple macro recorders. It automatically:

2. Swaps expensive apartments for cheap ones.
3. Reconnects and saves profit.
